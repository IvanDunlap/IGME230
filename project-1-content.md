# Lil Blob

## I. High Concept
Help your blob dodge incoming bullets by tapping where it should go and directing it towards powerups.
## II. Genre
It is definitely an avoidance game.
## III. Platform
It will likely just be on mobile.
## IV. Story
The blob is a growing little thing that relies on you to survive the dangerous world. There's a theme of constant danger, and the player progresses by surviving and grabbing powerups to gain points.
## V. Aesthetics
Definitely cartoonish and cutesy.
## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player will try to direct their character away from bullets and towards powerups.
### Controls
The playing is done by tapping; wherever the player taps, the blob heads towards.
### Teaching the player
A bit of text at the beginning and telling the user where to tap at the beginning should show them how to control. Tooltips can appear by new powerups as they appear.
### Player learning
Whenever the player gets a powerup, they increase in size - this encourages a player to figure out when it's safe to and when it's risky to grab a new powerup, since a bigger size means a greater chance to get hit, if not early on, then later.
Specific powerups can include temporary invincibility, a speed increase (temporary or permanent), a one-use "shield", the next three taps also creating a "bubble" of safety, and a negative powerup that increases your size without giving any more points towards victory.
